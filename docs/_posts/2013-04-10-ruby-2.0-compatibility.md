The latest version of ppl is available now, and it's one of those tiny,
pointless-sounding ones: `1.15.1`. This release is all about Ruby 2.0
compatibility.  A recent issue reported on GitHub by
[@pigmonkey](https://github.com/pigmonkey) brought to my attention that vpim,
ppl's underlying vCard library, [doesn't work at all in Ruby
2.0](https://github.com/h2s/ppl/issues/19).

    invalid multibyte escape: /^\xFF\xFE/

This is all better now, and ppl works as well in Ruby 2.0 as it does in the
1.9.\* range. This was a bit of a seismic change behind the scenes, and it
almost seems misleading to increment only the patch version number.

Essentially, I forked vpim in order to get this done. While this is an
unexpected turn of events, it does mean I'm now quite well-placed to fix its
UTF-8 issues myself instead of depending on the mercy of upstream. By the way,
if you're interested in helping with this, go take a look at
[greencard](https://github.com/h2s/greencard). It's vpim stripped down to just
the vCard functionality used by ppl. Go fork it!
