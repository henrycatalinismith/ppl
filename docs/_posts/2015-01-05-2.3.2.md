I'm very grateful to [@hobarrera](https://github.com/hobarrera) for contributing
this fix to [ppl scrape](/documentation/commands/scrape/). A simple mistake in
the output formatting code was causing it to appear slightly garbled, like this:

    Add "Hugo Osvaldo Barrera #<Ppl::Entity::EmailAddress:0x00000001ffbd28>>"
    to your address book [Y/n]?

So thanks for fixing that, Hugo!
