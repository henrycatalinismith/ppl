Two fairly minor issues are fixed in this version. The first is a tweak to the
output of the [mutt](/documentation/commands/mutt) command, improving the
[understandability and usefulness of the user-facing
text](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/20#issuecomment-16302428). The second is
a bit of output sanitisation to help out people unlucky enough to have an
address book where some of the contacts' fields contain `^M` [carriage return
characters](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/27).

* Tweaked the output of the [mutt](/documentation/commands/mutt) command
* Add output sanitisation removing all `^M` characters from all output
