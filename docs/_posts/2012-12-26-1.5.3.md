There have been a lot of internal changes in this release, and one user-facing
change to improve the error message when a non-existent contact is specified in
a command.

Before this change, non-existent contacts resulted in a fairly cryptic error
message consisting only of the given non-existent contact ID. From now on the
problem is actually explained to the user.

* Added a proper error message when a non-existent contact is specified
