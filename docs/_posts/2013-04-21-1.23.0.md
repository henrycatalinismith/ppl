Unusually for a ppl release, this one doesn't add any new core functionality or
fix any bugs. Instead, this release is solely an update to the [Bash
integration](/documentation/integration/bash/). The following improvements have
been made to the bash completion.

* It now returns command name suggestions much more quickly
* It can autocomplete email addresses for use with [`ppl
  email`](/documentation/commands/email)
* It can autocomplete nicknames for use with [`ppl
  nick`](/documentation/commands/nick)
* It can autocomplete organizations for use with [`ppl
  org`](/documentation/commands/org)
* It can autocomplete phone numbers for use with [`ppl
  phone`](/documentation/commands/phone)
* It can autocomplete URLs for use with [`ppl url`](/documentation/commands/url)
* It can autocomplete git remotes for use with
  [`pull`](/documentation/commands/pull) and
  [`push`](/documentation/commands/push)

For example, if you're attempting to amend the `--type` of a contact's phone
number, you can now enter `ppl phone adam 071<Tab>` and Bash will autocomplete
the rest of the phone number.

See the [Bash integration guide](/documentation/integration/bash) for details of
how to install the updated completion function to your system.
