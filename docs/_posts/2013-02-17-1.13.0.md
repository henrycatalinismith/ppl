The result of a lot of thought, this is the long-awaited git synchronisation
functionality. What's been added are three new commands,
[pull](/documentation/commands/pull), [push](/documentation/commands/push), and
[remote](/documentation/commands/remote). These commands have no behaviour of
their own, and are effectively aliases that execute their git counterparts
inside the address book's directory.

I think that this functionality is a good compromise: synchronising address book
data can be accomplished using simple, familiar commands such as `ppl pull
origin master`, and ppl itself is not unduly burdened with duplicating any git
functionality.

Another positive outcome of this work is that it brings proper git-style "bang"
aliases closer to being a reality. The code changes required for these three
commands lay a lot of the foundations necessary for bang aliases.

* Added `ppl pull` command
* Added `ppl push` command
* Added `ppl remote` command
