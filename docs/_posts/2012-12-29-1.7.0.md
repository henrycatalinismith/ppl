This version contains some fairly substantial changes to the way the [ppl
show](/documentation/commands/show) command formats its output. The need for
this change was unearthed by a [question from
@storge](https://github.com/h2s/ppl/issues/14) on GitHub. In short, the command
was only showing one of the given contact's email addresses, giving the
impression that this was all that ppl supported storing.

* Improved the output format of `ppl show`
