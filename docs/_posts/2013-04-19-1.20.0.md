In order to fix a [compatibility issue with OS
X](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/22#issuecomment-16622923), the usage of sed
to strip ANSI color escape codes in the autocompletion functions has been
replaced with a `--no-color` option which has been added to [ppl
nick](/documentation/commands/nick).
