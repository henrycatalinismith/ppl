Yesterday I worked up the courage to submit this project to Hacker News under
the usual [Show HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947047) format. I was
pleasantly surprised by how positive the feedback was overall. It was especially
heartening to confirm that I'm not the only person out there who would be
interested in using a command line address book!

As a result of all the attention that came flooding in, questions were asked and
answered, bugs were reported and fixed, and features were suggested and
implemented. It was a really fun day.

The elephant in the room is obviously sync functionality at this point.  Lots
and lots of people have made it very clear that even though they think this
project is a great idea it is useless in the extreme to them unless it can sync
with their GMail or iCloud. Rest assured that [this has not gone
unnoticed](https://github.com/urael/ppl/issues/5).

Stay tuned!
