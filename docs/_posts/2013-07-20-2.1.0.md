With thanks to [@pigmonkey](https://github.com/pigmonkey) for raising this as
[issue #42](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/42) on GitHub, version 2.1.0
brings increased control over the names of contacts. This is intended to improve
interoperability with other address book software, including the Android
system's contact list.

Short, lower case contact IDs are great for a CLI program, but on a phone, you
probably want to see full names. This update provides full access to all the
bits & pieces of vCard's `N` (name) field:

* Family name(s)
* Middle name(s)
* Given name(s)
* Prefix
* Suffix

See the documentation of [ppl name](/documentation/commands/name/) for more
details on how to use this new functionality.

Also included is some slightly different behaviour under the hood of [ppl
add](/documentation/commands/name/).  This command now attempts to "have a
guess" at the structure of the name of a newly-added contact. It'll treat the
first word of the full name as the contact's given name, and the rest of the
string as their family name. This is a shamefully anglocentric approach to name
parsing, but at least it's a start.
