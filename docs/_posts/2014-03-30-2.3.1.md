Once again, I'm grateful to [@alexGschaider] for his patience. This minor
version fixes a couple of annoying little problems that he's bumped into.

The first problem was a pretty terrible error message which was displayed when a
`.vcf` file contains invalid vCard data. This has now been fixed, and the error
message replaced with something much more sensible.

    $ ppl show badcontact
    ppl: badcontact.vcf contains invalid data

The second was yet another `Encoding::CompatibilityError`, just like back in the
bad old days before ppl even supported UTF-8 at all. Hopefully this will be the
last one of those now!
