<h2>About ppl</h2>

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <p>
      ppl was created to address the need for a decentralized address book
      storage system. There are a lot of different contact details storage
      solutions out there and they all have their own strengths. What was
      lacking was one that I felt I could count on to entrust with the "master
      copy" of all the disparate contact information I possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also intended to address the apparent lack of a proper CLI address
      book. There are people who enjoy the conversational nature of CLI
      interaction. You ask "Whose birthdays are coming up soon?", the computer
      answers immediately, and your interaction with the software is over with
      no further requirements that you close a window or slide a widget.
    </p>

    <h3>Why the CLI?</h3>
    <p>
      The command-line is a good fit for address book software because data
      about contacts is usually 100% plain text. It also works well because a
      given user interaction with an address book typically consists of one
      short operation: reading or writing a single piece of data. And since we
      normally want to keep our address book data for our entire lives, the
      command-line's immunity to the shifting sands of GUI toolkits and
      discontinued SaaS products is a big plus.
    </p>

    <h3>Why Git?</h3>
    <p>
      ppl uses git as its storage backend. Git's decentralised approach really
      suits this usage as it allows continued read/write access to the address
      book in the face of network downtime and cloud outages. And because git
      never destroys data, no botched sync attempt can permanently wipe an
      entire address book by accident.
    </p>

    <h3>Who?</h3>
    <p>
      This software was conceived and created by me, Henry Smith.
      I have a bunch of <a href="http://github.com/hnrysmth/">other stuff on
      GitHub too</a>!
    </p>

    <h3>When?</h3>
    <p>
      According to the project's git logs, work on ppl first began on November
      10th 2012. Apparently I had nothing more exciting to be doing at 11pm on a
      Saturday night.
