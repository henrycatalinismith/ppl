<h2>About ppl</h2>

    <h3>Why</h3>
    <p>
      ppl was created to address the need for a decentralized address book
      storage system. There are a lot of different contact details storage
      solutions out there and they all have their own strengths. What was
      lacking was one that I felt I could count on to entrust with the "master
      copy" of all the disparate contact information I possess.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's also intended to address the apparent lack of a proper CLI address
      book. There are people who enjoy the conversational nature of CLI
      interaction. You ask "Whose birthdays are coming up soon?", the computer
      answers immediately, and your interaction with the software is over with
      no further requirements that you close a window or slide a widget.

    <h3>Who</h3>
    <p>
      This software was conceived and created by me, <a
      href="http://henrysmith.org">Henry Smith</a>, some guy who likes writing
      code. I care about code quality and software freedom, and I often prefer
      to use the CLI for tasks involving just plain text.
    </p>
    <h3>When</h3>
    <p>
      According to the project's git logs, work on ppl first began on November
      10th 2012. Apparently I had nothing more exciting to be doing at 11pm on a
      Saturday night.
