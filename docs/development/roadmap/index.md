### Improved Expressiveness

Some small amount of demand has arisen on GitHub for the ability to mark email
addresses and phone numbers as
[preferred](https://github.com/urael/ppl/issues/25), and to be able to mark phone
numbers with a [type](https://github.com/urael/ppl/issues/24). These are helpful
as concrete examples of the sort of expressiveness still lacking from ppl's
commands which will be addressed in the not-too-distant future.

### Improved Integrability

There has been talk on GitHub of providing a means of [scraping email
addresses](https://github.com/urael/ppl/issues/23) out of email messages, and of
[importing already-encoded vCard
data](https://github.com/urael/ppl/issues/27#issuecomment-16373162) directly using
ppl add. These, and other such additions, are likely to arrive with the passage
of time as ppl works to become easier to integrate into existing systems and
workflows.
