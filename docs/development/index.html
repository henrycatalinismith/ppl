      You'd like to contribute to the development of ppl? Great!
      Here's a quick introduction.
    </p>

    <h3>Report A Bug</h3>
    <p>
      This project uses Github Issues to track bug reports. The tracker is at
      <a href="https://github.com/h2s/ppl/issues">github.com/h2s/ppl/issues</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Get The Code</h3>
    <p>
      The main source repository for ppl is hosted on GitHub at <a
      href="https://github.com/h2s/ppl">github.com/h2s/ppl</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Do Your Best</h3>
    <p>
      For low-level code style issues relating to issues such as syntax and
      indentation, <a href="https://github.com/styleguide/ruby">GitHub's Ruby
      Styleguide</a> is the standard to follow*. This project doesn't necessarily
      follow the guide perfectly, but pull requests that improve adherence to the
      guide are welcomed whereas pull requests that stray even further are
      discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      For higher-level issues, the "Object Mentor school of clean code" as
      described by the book <a
      href="http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Clean_Code.html?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC">Clean
      Code</a> has the final word. Again, this project isn't a perfect
      representation of this methodology, but any movement in that direction is
      encouraged.
