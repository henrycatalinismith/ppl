ppl aims to be address book software for command-line users. It's pronounced
like "people". You might be interested in ppl if:

* You like using the command-line
* You want ownership of your address book data back from the cloud
* You prefer to keep your data stored in an open format

The Plan
--------

ppl's command-line interface is based on those of Git and Heroku. For example:


    $ ppl list
    fred       Fred Smith   fred.smith@example.org
    dave       Dave Jones   dave.jones@example.org
    joe        Joe Bloggs   joe.bloggs@example.org

Or...

    $ ppl show fred
    Fred Smith
    fred.simth@example.org
