With no arguments, the phone numbers of each contact in the address book are
listed.

If a `<contact>` is specified, the phone number of that contact is shown.

If both a `<contact>` and a `<phone-number>` are given, then the number is added
to the contact's phone numbers.

It the `--delete` or `-d` flag is set, then the given `<phone-number>` is
deleted from the specified `<contact>`.

Use the `--type <type>` option to assign a type to the phone number. You can use
this option both when adding a new number or to amend an existing number.

The `--preferred` and `--not-preferred` flags are for marking a given phone
number as "preferred" or not. Internally, this status is represented with
vCard's `TYPE=pref` parameter in the `TEL` field. Preferred phone numbers are
shown with a `*` next to them in the output of `ppl phone <contact>`.
