title: UTF-8 Fixed And More
date: 2013-04-15

Over the weekend, in an uncharacteristically late night of coding, I finally put
an end to that UTF-8 issue that had been preventing the [use of ppl with
non-ASCII characters](https://github.com/hendotcat/ppl/issues/17) such as ß or ñ. My
apologies to anyone who wanted to try ppl and couldn't during the *two entire
months* that issue sat open. If it's any consolation, fixing it gave me many
headaches.

Even though it's only been a few days since the previous news post, there has
been a lot of progress in that time, thanks largely to the involvement and
encouragement of [@pigmonkey](https://github.com/pigmonkey) and
[@shushcat](https://github.com/shushcat) on GitHub. Some good refinements to the
[mutt integration](/integrations/mutt/) have already made it into
recent versions of ppl, and there's some good discussion happening about what
needs doing to keep improving ppl in the near future.

The [documentation](/) has had some much-needed attention invested
in it, too. A few bits and pieces have been tidied up, and a couple of entirely
new sections have been added as well. The [Integration
Guide](/integrations) covers the growing number of ways of
using ppl with other software, and the Tips Section should prove to be a good
catch-all place for helpful advice about using ppl.

Contributions are welcome, so get in touch if you spot any mistakes, have any
tips to contribute, or know of any tools for integrating ppl into other
software. Big thanks to everyone for your input so far. Shout out to
[@alexGschaider](https://github.com/axelGschaider),
[@matthewp](https://github.com/matthewp/), and
[@storge](https://github.com/storge) for their help as well.
