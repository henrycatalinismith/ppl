version: 2.2.0
summary: ppl scrape overwrite prevention
date: 2013-07-20

Thanks again to [@pigmonkey](https://github.com/pigmonkey) for [issue #32](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/32),
reporting some unhelpful destructive behaviour in [ppl
scrape](/documentation/commands/scrape/). In this version, some additional
checking has been added to that command to prevent it from overwriting existing
contacts.

In the event that the scraped contact ID happens to match that of an existing
contact, ppl scrape will now notice this collision and append numbers to the new
ID until it no longer matches any existing contact's IDs.
