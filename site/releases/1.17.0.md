This is a peculiar version in that it doesn't change any code in ppl itself, but
simultaneously fixes a really major issue that's been affecting it. All this
version does is to increment the greencard gem dependency version number to a
version that copes with UTF-8 input. It's a *tiny* change, but it's a major
improvement.
