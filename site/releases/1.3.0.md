summary: XDG-compatible configuration

Adds support for XDG-compatible configuration. Many thanks to
[@tijn](https://github.com/hendotcat/ppl/issues/4) on GitHub for [recommending this
functionality](https://github.com/hendotcat/ppl/issues/4).

This means ppl can now be alternatively configured using a file at
`~/.config/ppl/config`. If you like keeping your `~/` free of dotfile clutter
then this is good news. If not, don't worry, `~/.pplconfig` continues working as
normal.

* Add support for XDG-compatible configuration file location
