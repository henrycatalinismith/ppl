A relatively small release in terms of new functionality, `1.2.0` simply adds
the [ppl post](/commands/post) command. This command was always in
the pipeline, but thanks anways to
[nicky0](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nicky0) on Hacker News for
prompting me to prioritise it slightly.

* Added `ppl post` command
