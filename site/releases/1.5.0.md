The addition of "interactive mode" in the form of [ppl
shell](/commands/shell). Thanks to
[@axelGschaider](https://github.com/axelGschaider) on GitHub for [the
suggestion](https://github.com/hendotcat/ppl/issues/7). This ought to make life a lot
easier for people entering lots of commands at once!

* Added `ppl shell` command
