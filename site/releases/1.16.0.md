version: 1.16.0
summary: Mutt integration tweaks

With a couple of tweaks to the way ppl handles mutt queries, `1.16.0` should be
a nice improvement for anybody using ppl to autocomplete email addresses in the
mail client that "just sucks less".

* Added missing functionality to the [mutt](/documentation/commands/mutt)
  command enabling it to output *all* of a contact's matching email addresses
  instead of just the first.
* Added the `-i` flag to the [mutt](/documentation/commands/mutt) command
  enabling it to perform case-insensitive search of the address book.

Many thanks to [@pigmonkey](https://github.com/pigmonkey) on GitHub for the
cooperation that made this release happen.
