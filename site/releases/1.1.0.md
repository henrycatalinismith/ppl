These are some very quickly added changes resulting from this morning's
exposure on Hacker News. A few real show-stopping bugs have been fixed, and a
new feature has been added for mutt users.

Many thanks to [@storge](https://github.com/storge) on GitHub for all the help
fixing the long series of issues in [Issue #1](https://github.com/hendotcat/ppl/issues/1). You absolute legend.

Also, thanks to [7h0ma5](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=7h0ma5) on HN for
the mutt integration suggestion and the helpful documentation link. Support for
usage as the backend to mutt's `query_command` option has been added in the
form of [ppl mutt](/commands/mutt).

* Fixed missing dependency declaration in gemspec
* Fixed missing minimum ruby version in gemspec
* Fixed completely broken and useless `ppl init` command
* Added `ppl mutt` command
