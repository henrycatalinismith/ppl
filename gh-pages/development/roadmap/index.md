As of January 2018 this project is in quite a stable state, with no major
increases in functionality planned. That being said, I'm not actually against
adding more functionality to this thing if somebody out there feels like taking
on the implementation work. I'm very very open to adding lots more stuff, just
not interested in creating it myself.

Please don't hesitate to get in touch if you have ideas for ppl that you want to
build and contribute!
