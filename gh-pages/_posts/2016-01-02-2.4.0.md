If you've ever looked at the commit history that ppl generates in your address
book you'll have noticed the ugly-looking commit author. [@drewbug] certainly
noticed and took the time to do something about it.

As of this version, ppl pulls in your Git config and uses your `user.name` and
`user.email` if available. If not, it falls back to the old (ugly) author
generation.
