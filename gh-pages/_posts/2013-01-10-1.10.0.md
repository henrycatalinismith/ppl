A lot of the work in this release went into some much-needed refactoring as a
precautionary measure against accumulating too much technical debt early on. The
code reuse enabled by this refactor facilitated the addition of some key
functionality, too.

* Added support for storing multiple organizations with `ppl org` command
* Added support for storing multiple phone numbers with `ppl phone` command
* Added support for deleting phone numbers with `ppl phone` command
