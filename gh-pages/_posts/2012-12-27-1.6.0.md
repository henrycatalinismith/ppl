This release contains a bugfix and the means for users to undo the minor damage
caused by the bug. The bug was causing every new email address added by users to
be saved against the contact *twice*. The fix stops that from happening. And a
new feature has been added in the form of a `--delete` flag for [ppl
email](/documentation/commands/email) so that dupliate addresses can be removed.

* Fixed a bug causing duplicate email addresses to be saved
* Added `--delete` flag to `ppl email`
