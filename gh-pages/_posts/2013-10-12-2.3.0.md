With thanks to [@ajford](https://github.com/ajford) for the excellent [feature
request](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/43), version 2.3.0 brings a new
command: [ppl grep](/documentation/commands/grep/). This command leverages the
extremely high speed search `git grep` repository search in order to provide
near-instant search results.
