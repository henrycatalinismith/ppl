This version is a first step towards removing the annoying limitation of one
email address, postal address and so on per contact. This isn't glamorous work
but it's vital functionality.

The ability to add more than one email address to a contact has been added. This
is not 100% complete: email addresses cannot yet be deleted, for example. And
[ppl show](/documentation/commands/show) does not yet show all the addresses
(only [ppl email](/documentation/commands/email) does for now). But at least
it's now possible to store the data

* Contacts can now have more than one email address
