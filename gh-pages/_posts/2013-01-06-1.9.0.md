This release adds two new features: the [version
command](/documentation/commands/version), and support for
[aliases](/documentation/configuration/alias). Both features function similarly
to their git counterparts, albeit in a less complete way. For now the aliasing
only supports simple aliasing of plain command names, and doesn't allow things
like aliasing long chains of arguments or git's `!f() {}` style commands. These
things will come in time.

* Added `ppl version` command
* Added rudimentary alias support
