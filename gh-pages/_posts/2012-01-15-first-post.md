After a solid month or so of work, the first stable version of ppl has been
released to the public. This version includes the ability to store contacts'
names, organizations, email addresses, phone numbers, and birthdays.

It's by no means feature complete at this stage, and the
[roadmap](/development/roadmap) has details of the known deficiencies in this
release.
