The release of `1.14.0` exposed a small screw-up in ppl's alias support. The
`[alias]` section of the `~/.pplconfig` file was not being picked up at all.
Instead it was looking for a section called `[aliases]`, which was insconsistent
with the documentation and with git, on which the functionality is based. This
release, therefore, is a fix for this issue: an `[alias]` section in
`.pplconfig` should now work as described.

* Fixed `[alias]` configuration
