With the intention of streamlining the integration process with
[Bash](/documentation/integration/bash), and
[ZSH](/documentation/integration/zsh), this release adds the
[completion](/documentation/commands/completion) command. This new command
simply outputs the chosen shell autocompletion function to stdout.
