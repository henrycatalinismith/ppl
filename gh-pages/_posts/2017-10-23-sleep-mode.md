This project seems to be in a good stable state. There's a small active
userbase who are mostly content with the software as-is. Not a lot of
maintenance or feature work is necessary these days and I can't justify
spending money on a domain for a project that's just chilling like this.

I'm converting the whole thing into a single, easy-to-look-after repo in my
own personal GitHub account and disabling autorenew on `ppladdressbook.org`.
Wanna make it clear that I consider this a fairly decent set of circumstances
for the project to be in btw. It mostly just works and that's for the best
cos I don't really have a lot of time to maintain and fix it any more.
