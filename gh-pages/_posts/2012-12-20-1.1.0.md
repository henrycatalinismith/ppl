These are some very quickly added changes resulting from this morning's exposure
on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947047). A few real
show-stopping bugs have been fixed, and a new feature has been added for mutt
users.

Many thanks to [@storge](https://github.com/storge) on GitHub for all the help
fixing the long series of issues in [Issue #1](https://github.com/hnrysmth/ppl/issues/1). You absolute legend.

Also, thanks to [7h0ma5](http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=7h0ma5) on HN for
the [mutt integration suggestion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4947256)
and the helpful documentation link. Support for usage as the backend to mutt's
`query_command` option has been added in the form of [ppl
mutt](/documentation/commands/mutt).

* Fixed missing dependency declaration in gemspec
* Fixed missing minimum ruby version in gemspec
* Fixed completely broken and useless `ppl init` command
* Added `ppl mutt` command
