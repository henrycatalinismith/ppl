Added another attribute that contacts often have: URLs. For example, a given
contact may have a profile page on some social network, a personal website, or
any number of different possibilities. The new comand, [ppl
url](/documentation/commands/url), works similarly to [ppl
email](/documentation/commands/email) and allows you to store these URLs in your
address book.

* Added `ppl url` command
