This release brings the very basic first customizability to the output of ppl's
commands. As of this version, it's possible to pass a `--format` option to [`ppl
email`](/documentation/commands/email) and [`ppl
ls`](/documentation/commands/ls) to specify the exact nature of the output
required. Also part of this new version is the ability to configure preset
format strings for [`ppl ls`](/documentation/commands/ls)  in `~/.pplconfig` and
invoke them by name using the `--pretty` option.

Obviously, this type of functionality has the potential to be added to just
about all of ppl's output. In time, that will happen. For now, this gets the
basic functionality out there for use.
