It's pronounced\r\nlike \"people\". You might be interested in ppl if:\r\n\r\n* You like using the command-line\r\n* You want ownership of your address book data back from the cloud\r\n* You prefer to keep your data stored in an open format\r\n\r\nppl is in an incomplete state right now, and is in active development. Stay\r\ntuned.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/h2s/ppl.png)](http://travis-ci.org/h2s/ppl)\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ sudo gem install ppl\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\n### List all contacts\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl ls\r\ndave: dave@example.org\r\nfred: fred@example.org\r\njohn: john@example.org\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Add a contact\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl add paul \"Paul Baker\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Show a contact\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl show fred\r\nFred Smith\r\nfred@example.org\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Delete a contact\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl rm dave\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change a contact's ID\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl mv dave david\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change a contact's name\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl name john \"John Smith\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change a contact's email address\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl email dave david@example.org\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Change a contact's birthday\r\n```bash\r\n$ ppl birthday john 1980-01-01\r\n```\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\n\r\nOne of the core ideas of ppl is for it to turn your address book into a Git\r\nrepository. In an earlier version, this was achieved using\r\n[Rugged](https://github.com/libgit2/rugged). This functionality will be added\r\nback in so that contact information can be easily synced between computers. In\r\nthe meantime, ppl simply writes to disk.\r\n\r\nOther data about contacts will also be supported, such as:\r\n* Postal addresses\r\n* Phone numbers\r\n* The name of the organization to which the contact belongs\r\n* The position of the contact within their organization\r\n\r\nThe email address handling is currently very rudimentary. The eventual plan is\r\nto support storage of several addresses per contact. Addresses will be able to\r\nbe organized according to location, such as \"home\" or \"work\", and it will be\r\npossible to mark a particular address as \"preferred\" for each location.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick mockup of the sort of output `ppl show` should produce a little\r\nfurther down the road once some of these goals have been reached:\r\n\r\n    Fred Smith <fred.smith@example.org>\r\n\r\n    -- Email Addresses -------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n       Home\r\n     * fred.smith@example.org\r\n       fsmith@aol.com\r\n\r\n       Work\r\n     * fred.smith@megacorp.com\r\n       fred.s.123@initrode.net\r\n\r\n    -- Postal Addresses ------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n       Home\r\n       1 Testing Road, TestVille, Testing, CA, 12345\r\n\r\n       Work\r\n       30 Business Road, TestVille, Testing, CA, 23454\r\n\r\n    -- Telephone Numbers -----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n       01234567891\r\n       09876541233\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\n\r\nBug reports, fixes, and additional features are encouraged. The project uses\r\n[Github issues](https://github.com/h2s/ppl/issues) to track bug reports.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to contribute code, please just bear in mind that ppl development\r\nis test-driven and attempts to follow the \"Object Mentor school of clean code\"\r\nas described in the book [Clean\r\nCode](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_i6bDeoCQzsC).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nppl is licensed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.\r\n\r\n","name":"Ppl","google":""}
